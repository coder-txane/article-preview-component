## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I initially built this project using Tailwind CSS for the first time. While I was able to build with it, it made me realise how much more I needed to improve my CSS skills and understanding of NPM. Moving forward, I will also work on implenting more Semantic HTML in future projects.
